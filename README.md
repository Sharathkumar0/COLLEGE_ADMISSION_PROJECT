# COLLEGE_ADMISSION_PROJECT

**BUSINESS PROBLEM:** To get the University details in the United states based on student scores. By using the machine learning models to find the best eligible universities.


**CONTENT:**
The dataset contains university information i.e student acceptance test score, top10 ratio, acceptance ratio by the university, expenses of the university, student faculty ratio, graduation ratio.
DATASET: Click here to get the dataset


Student Acceptance Test Score: University eligible test score.

Top10 Ratio: University percentage in top10.

Acceptance Ratio by University: It is the percentage of the students who get accepted after going through the application process of the university.

Student Faculty Ratio: A teacher-student ratio of 1:10 indicates that there is 1 teacher for every 10 students.

University Expenses: Yearly expenses of the university.

Graduation Ratio: Annual graduation rate from the university.



**MACHINE LEARNING MODEL:**

**UNSUPERVISED ML:** Unsupervised ML is a class of ML techniques to find the patterns in data.
The data given to Unsupervised algorithms are not labeled, Which means only the input variables are given with no corresponding output variables.
No defined dependent and independent variables. Patterns in the data are used to identify group similar observations.

**CLUSTERING:** Clustering is primarily an exploratory technique to discover hidden structures of the data. A way to decompose a data into subsets with each subset representing a group with similar characteristics. Groups are known as ‘CLUSTERS’ and each cluster gets a distinct label called ‘CLUSTER ID’ /‘MEMBERSHIP ID’. ( Used Centroid Based Clustering: K MEANS CLUSTERING).
