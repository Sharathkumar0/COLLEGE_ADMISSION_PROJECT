# COLLEGE_ADMISSION_PROJECT

**BUSINESS PROBLEM:** Get the University Information to apply to universities in the United States of America. 
NOTE: Use the MACHINE LEARNING MODELS to find out the best results.

**CONTENT:**
The dataset contains the information of the universities. Information about Student Acceptance Test Score, Top10 Ratio, Accept Ratio by the university, Expenses of the university, Student Faculty Ratio and Graduation Ratio.


**MACHINE LEARNING MODEL:**

**UNSUPERVISED ML:** Unsupervised ML is a class of ML techniques to find the patterns in data.
The data given to Unsupervised algorithms are not labeled, Which means only the input variables are given with no corresponding output variables.
No defined dependent and independent variables. Patterns in the data are used to identify group similar observations.

**CLUSTERING:** Clustering is primarily an exploratory technique to discover hidden structures of the data. A way to decompose a data into subsets with each subset representing a group with similar characteristics. Groups are known as ‘CLUSTERS’ and each cluster gets a distinct label called ‘CLUSTER ID’ /‘MEMBERSHIP ID’. ( Used Centroid Based Clustering: K MEANS CLUSTERING).
